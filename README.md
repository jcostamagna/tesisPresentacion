- "mergeData_fixed_time.csv": Data processed from investigation.
- "Thesis_fixed_time_data_full.ipynb": Working from "mergeData_fixed_time.csv" with ML algorithms.
- "Thesis_fixed_time_data_top_5_features.ipynb": Working only with top 5 features of "mergeData_fixed_time.csv".
- "thesis_molding_fixed_time.ipynb": Notebook where I created "mergeData_fixed_time.csv". Not all data available to run
